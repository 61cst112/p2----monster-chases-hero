# p2:    Monster chases hero.
Monster stalks the hero, who hunts for gold; dog follows hero

# p2
Project #2 -- Use objects to create a dynamic sketch, including:
+ scene with sky, grass, sun, tree, and house,  
+ a hero who chases the gold,
+ a dog that follows the hero, and
+ a monster that slowly chases the hero.
Add titles and a score.  
**NOTE:**  All requirements from Project #1 also apply to Project #2.

## SCENE:
+ sky
+ sun -- moves across the sky, at a random height
+ grass (below the "horizon")
+ tree with brown trunk (rectangle above horizon) and green leaves (ellipse) 
+ house -- with roof, door, and windows

## GOLD
+ A sparkling gold nugget appears at mouse position (mouseX,mouseY) when mouse is clicked

## HERO
+ shirt with name on it
+ pants and legs
+ arms
+ head and eyes
Hero moves toward the gold.

## DOG:
+ body (low, brown rectangle)
+ head (small rectangle at one end) with eye
+ tail (sticking up at the other end.
+ legs sticking downward, at each end.  _(animated?)_

Dog rapidly moves toward the hero.  
+ head should be at the front, tail at the back
+ _(can you animate the legs?)_  

## MONSTER:
+ make up your own _(scary)_ shape
+ monster slowly moves toward the hero.

# Object Oriented Design and Programming
#### Write simple object classes for each of the the following:
```
    class Gold { 
        //... 
    }
    class Hero { 
        //... 
    }
    class Dog { 
        //... 
    }
    class Monster { 
        //... 
    }
```
#### Write Java code to accomplish the above requirements.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fork this "repo"  
2. Create a new file named `p2-lastname.java`  
    where **lastname** is  *YOUR* last name 
    *(first three or more letters)*
